***** Global Operations Tier 3, Converged Services Management Center | El Segundo, California | May 2008 - Sept 2009
   - Implemented a computer vision application utilizing the OpenCV API to notify technicians of network alarm status. The system utilized machine vision to collect a series of screenshots in sequence and would detect when an "excess" amount of "red" was on the monitor. 
   This indicated there were a lot of "problems" on the network. From here, the system would generate an audible alarm to alert the operator that a particular platform was having issues and required attention. 
   This created a platform-agnostic alerting system and allowed the technician to concentrate on only the most important issues. 
   - Created a platform-agnostic automated ticket closure system using the windows based AutoHotKey API, JavaScript, and the OpenCV libraries. 
   The system executed a set of customizable sequences of mouse clicks to automate a routine "ticket closure" procedure which otherwise averaged anywhere from 1-4 hours of a technician's time per night. 
   The system would execute the instructions in about 2-16 minutes, depending on the number of tickets. 
   - Provided Tier 3 support, including the provisioning, maintenance and performance monitoring of BT-Infonet's internet backbone; in a cross-platform; mixed vendor environment. Platforms included:
   Cisco, Alcatel Lucent, Juniper & Cienna based equipment. Protocols included: MPLS, EIGRP, IGRP, Frame-Relay, TCP/IP V4/V6, SIP, ARP, CDP, EIGRP, OSPF, BGP, VTP, Etherchannel, 802.1Q trunking, QoS, Multicast, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, IPSec, LDAP, RADIUS/TACACS+, SNMP, NTP, VRF and HTTP/HTTPS.
