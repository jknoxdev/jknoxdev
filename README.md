# Welcome to the Github Repo for Justin Knox! 

While most of the software that I have written is propietary; I will attempt to recreate "in essense" the types of applications that I have written in my enterprise experience, as well as hopefully gather a site to demonstrate the functionality of each of these projects! 

Most of the live demos are available on [tkl337](https://www.tkl337.net)

Thanks for taking a look around and feel free to check out my [resume](https://www.tkl337.net) to contact me.
