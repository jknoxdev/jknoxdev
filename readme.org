I build and secure the "un-breakables." With over 20 years of experience managing mission-critical infrastructure—from Google's network operations to municipal water cyber-defense—I specialize in the intersection of high-availability systems and hardened security protocols.

** 🛰️ Current Focus
Space/Aerospace OT: Hardening telemetry and command protocols for next-gen orbital assets.
Distributed AI Infrastructure: Designing secure, multi-tenant Kubernetes environments for LLM inference and training.
Security by Design: Implementing Zero Trust architectures in legacy IT/OT environments.

** 🛠️ The Workbench (Home Lab)
Hypervisors: Clustered Proxmox / KVM
Network: OPNsense with hardened WireGuard tunnels & VLAN segmentation.
Automation: Ansible-driven provisioning and automated patch management.

** 📜 Certifications
 - CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)
 - CISA (Certified Information Security Auditor)
 - OSCP (In Progress - Expected 2026)

Currently relocating to the DACH region (CH/DE)
